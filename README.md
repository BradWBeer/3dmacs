3Dmacs
======

The spirit of the Emacs text editor taken into the 3rd dimension

# The Idea 

Use Common Lisp and the Clinch Graphics Engine to create a universal editor.

# The Plan

Create a Document Object Model similar to modern web browsers DOM API. The ability to work with 2D and 3D with the same tools and a single language should produce a powerful system for displaying, editing and sharing documents of any kind.
